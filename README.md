### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Joachim! Nice of you to stop by. Let me tell you a little bit about me and what I do.

I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect specializing in Azure, Azure DevOps and .NET.

My main focus areas revolves around:

- Infrastructure Engineering
- Developer Experience
- Automation

I also enjoy the challenges that comes with desiging software and infrastructure architecture.

## Projects

Currently not working on anything :(

### My repositories

Like many other developers I have a lot of unfinished projects and a lot of them you fill find under this project. I tend to not delete any projects, but that does not mean I will come back to them. Feel free to submit an issue on any of them if you have any questions.
